# plotly_challenge

This project used the D3.js library to read in a jason file of belly botton biodiversity and use that dataset to create a dashboard.
I used the "Live Server Extenson by Ritick Day", on VS code to open a server on my local machine.

The Dashboard is posted to the web at:  https://darenhamilton.github.io/plotly_challenge/
